## **1st Floor Stairs**

### **1\. Dimensional Overview**

* **Total Rise (Floor-to-Floor):** 135 7/8" (Note: Ensure the rough opening accounts for the finished floor heights).  
* **Total Run (Horizontal Length):** 172 1/8".  
* **Number of Risers:** 18\.  
* **Number of Treads:** 17\.  
* **Staircase Angle:** 36.71^circ.  
* **Clear Width:** 47".

### **2\. Component Details**

* **Finished Riser Height:** 7 9/16".  
* **Finished Tread Depth:** 10 1/8".  
* **Tread Thickness:** 1".  
* **Riser Thickness:** 3/4".  
* **Nosing Projection:** 1 1/8".

## **Construction Notes & Critical Adjustments**

### **Finish Floor Adjustments**

* **First Floor Finish:** 5/8".  
* **Second Floor Finish:** 5/8".  
* **Critical Note:** Since both the first and second floor finishes are identical (5/8"), the **Standard Riser Height** (7 9/16") remains consistent throughout the flight.  
* *Calculation Check:* The bottom riser must be cut 5/8" shorter than the others to account for the first-floor finish. When the 1" tread is added, the total height from the subfloor will be 8 3/16", which results in a 7 9/16" step once the 5/8" finish floor is installed.

### **Stringer Layout**

* **Stringer Material:** 11 7/8" LVL.  
* **Rise/Run Cut:** The stringer should be scribed for a 7 9/16" rise and a 10 1/8" run.  
* **Nosing:** Ensure the 1 1/8" nosing is accounted for when setting the horizontal depth of the tread material over the stringer run.

### **Structural Requirements**

* **Tread Support:** Use construction adhesive and finish nails/screws to secure 1" treads to stringers to prevent squeaking.  
* **Code Compliance:** Ensure the handrail height is between 34" and 38" measured vertically from the tread nosing.

### **1\. Mid Stair Support Beam**

A horizontal beam that spans between a beam pocket in a main wall and a face mount hanger on the opposing pony wall.

* **Hardware:** The beam is secured using **HU66 joist hanger** and **BC6 post caps** (or similar style connectors).

### **2\. The Stringer Attachment Points**

The two middle stringers are attached with "saddle-style" blocks to receive the stringers:

* **Material:** Each support point consists of a **1 3/4" LVL** core, mitered at the top to match the specific angle of the stair stringers.  
* **Reinforcement:** These LVL cores are flanked by **2x6 blocking** and **3/4" OSB** spacers to match BC6 hardware.

---

### **3. Left Stringer Support**

The left stringer is supported by the pony wall underneath it.

* **Apply Adhesive:** Lay a continuous 1/4" bead of polyurethane subfloor adhesive along the top plate of the pony wall.
* **Position Stringer:** Place the stringer on the wall and verify that it is plumb and aligned with your floor layout marks.
* **Select Fasteners:** Use 1/4" diameter structural wood screws (such as GRK RSS or Simpson SDWS) that are long enough to penetrate 2" into the stringer. Fasten at 12-inch intervals.

---

### **4. Right Stringer Support**

* **Wall Connection:** The right stringer shall be connected to the wall every 16" using structural screws.
* **Spacing:** 3/4" spacers should be used to leave room for skirt board.

### **5. Vertical Support Walls**

See wall detail page for drawings of stair walls.

---

### **6. Stair Header**

* **Material:** 14" LVL on top of center wall. LVL shall be secured to wall and trusses behind it.
* **Connection:** LSC or similar connector.

# Foundation

### **1.0 Excavation and Footings**

* **1.1 Frost Protection:** All exterior footings shall be placed on undisturbed soil with the bottom of the footing a minimum of **44 inches below the finished grade** to protect against frost heave. This depth should be verified with the local code official as it can vary based on specific site conditions.  
* **1.2 Soil Bearing Capacity:** The design of all footings is based on an assumed soil bearing capacity of **2,000 pounds per square foot (psf)**.  
* **1.3 Bearing Surface:** All footings are to be placed on solid, undisturbed ground. Any loose or unsuitable material must be excavated and replaced with compacted engineered fill as approved by the project engineer.  
* **1.4 Site Drainage:** The finished grade shall be sloped away from the foundation on all sides to ensure positive drainage of surface water. Provide drainage solutions to prevent the accumulation of water and soil erosion near the footings.

### **2.0 Concrete**

* **2.1 Compressive Strength:** The minimum allowable compressive strength for all foundation concrete shall be **3,000 psi** at 28 days.  
* **2.2 Concrete Mix:**  
  * **Cement:** Portland Cement, Type I or II.  
  * **Maximum Aggregate Size:** 1 inch.  
  * **Air Entrainment:** 4% \- 6% for concrete exposed to freezing and thawing conditions.

### **3.0 Reinforcement**

* **3.1 Material:** All reinforcing steel shall conform to **ASTM A-615, Grade 60**.  
* **3.2 Splicing:**  
  * For \#4 reinforcing bars, a minimum overlap of **24 inches** is required for all splices.  
  * For \#5 reinforcing bars, a minimum overlap of **36 inches** is required for all splices.  
* **3.3 Corner Bars:** Provide a minimum of two (2) \#4 reinforcing bars bent at 90 degrees at all corners of footings and foundation walls to ensure continuity of reinforcement.  
* **3.4 Coverage:** All reinforcing steel shall have a minimum of 3 inches of concrete coverage where concrete is in contact with the earth.

### **4.0 Foundation Walls & Anchorage**

* **4.1 Foundation Wall Height:** The top of the foundation walls shall extend a minimum of **6 inches above the adjacent finished grade**.  
* **4.2 Anchor Bolts:**  
  * **Type:** 1/2-inch diameter steel anchor bolts.  
  * **Embedment:** A minimum of 7 inches of embedment into the poured concrete foundation is required.  
  * **Spacing:** Anchor bolts shall be spaced a maximum of **4 feet on-center**.  
  * **Placement:** Place one anchor bolt within 12 inches of each end of a sill plate section, but no closer than 3.5 inches from the end. A minimum of two (2) anchor bolts are required per individual sill plate section.

1.0 General Notes & Compliance 1.1. Governing Codes: All work shall be performed in strict accordance with the current Pennsylvania Uniform Construction Code (UCC), which adopts the International Residential Code (IRC), and all applicable ordinances of Springettsbury Township. 1.2. Scope: These notes detail the installation of a complete foundation drainage system, comprising both an exterior footing drain and an interior perimeter drain, discharging to a sealed sump pump basin. 1.3. Inspections: The contractor shall notify the Springettsbury Township building inspector for a footing/foundation drain inspection prior to backfilling the exterior system or pouring the basement slab for the interior system. 1.4. Soil Conditions: These notes assume typical local soil conditions. Contractor to notify the project engineer if exceptionally poor-draining soils (e.g., heavy clay) or evidence of a high water table is encountered, as additional measures may be required.

2.0 Materials 2.1. Perforated Pipe: 4-inch diameter, white perforated PVC pipe conforming to ASTM D2729. Perforations shall be oriented downwards (at the 4 and 8 o'clock positions) upon installation. 2.2. Solid Pipe: 4-inch diameter, white solid PVC sewer and drain pipe (ASTM D2729 or Schedule 40) for discharge lines from the sump pump and for solid runs to daylight if applicable. 2.3. Drainage Aggregate: Washed, clean, crushed stone or gravel, 3/4-inch to 1.5-inch in diameter. Must be free of fines, dirt, and organic material. 2.4. Filter Fabric: Non-woven geotextile filter fabric, rated for soil filtration and drainage applications. To be used to wrap the aggregate trench. 2.5. Pipe Filter Sock: Spun-polyester or similar filter "sock" designed to fit over 4-inch perforated pipe. 2.6. Dampproofing/Waterproofing: As per architectural plans. At a minimum, foundation walls shall be dampproofed. A trowel-applied or spray-on waterproofing membrane is highly recommended. 2.7. Sump Basin & Pump: A 24-inch diameter, sealed sump basin with a solid, lockable cover. Sump pump shall be a minimum 1/3 HP submersible cast-iron model with an automatic float switch.

3.0 Exterior Foundation Drain System Installation 3.1. Foundation Preparation: After foundation footings are poured and cured, and prior to installing the drainage system, apply the specified dampproofing or waterproofing membrane to the exterior foundation walls. Allow membrane to cure as per manufacturer's instructions. 3.2. Trench Excavation: The trench for the drainpipe shall be excavated alongside the footing. 3.3. Pipe Placement & Slope: 3.3.1. Place a minimum 2-inch base of drainage aggregate in the bottom of the trench. 3.3.2. Install the 4-inch perforated PVC pipe, fitted with a filter sock, on top of the aggregate base. The top of the pipe shall be set at or slightly below the top of the concrete footing. 3.3.3. The pipe shall be laid with a positive slope of at least 1/8 inch per foot (1% grade) towards the discharge point (sump pit or daylight exit). Use a builder's level to verify slope continuously. 3.3.4. Connect pipe sections using appropriate PVC fittings. A continuous loop around the foundation is required. 3.4. Aggregate Backfill: 3.4.1. Carefully backfill over and around the pipe with drainage aggregate. 3.4.2. The aggregate shall extend to a minimum of 6 inches above the top of the footing and a minimum of 12 inches horizontally from the face of the foundation wall. 3.5. Filter Fabric Installation: 3.5.1. Lay the non-woven geotextile filter fabric over the top of the aggregate, overlapping all seams by at least 12 inches. 3.5.2. The fabric should extend up the foundation wall by at least 12 inches and be temporarily secured. This separates the drainage aggregate from the backfill soil, preventing clogging. 3.6. Connection to Sump Pit: A solid PVC pipe shall be used to connect the high point of the exterior footing drain to one of the knockout inlets on the sump basin. Ensure a watertight seal at the basin penetration. 3.7. Initial Backfill: Place an initial 12-inch layer of native soil or approved fill material carefully over the filter fabric to hold it in place. Do not use heavy machinery directly over the drain system. Final backfilling can proceed after inspection approval.

4.0 Interior Foundation Drain System Installation 4.1. Pre-Slab Preparation: This system is installed after the basement sub-base is graded and compacted, but before the vapor barrier and concrete slab are placed. 4.2. Trenching: A trench shall be created around the full interior perimeter of the basement, adjacent to the footing. 4.3. Pipe Installation: 4.3.1. Place a 2-inch base of drainage aggregate in the trench. 4.3.2. Install 4-inch perforated PVC pipe (with perforations down) on the aggregate base, maintaining a positive slope towards the sump basin. 4.3.3. Connect the pipe into a continuous loop and run a solid pipe from the loop to the sump basin, ensuring a watertight connection. 4.4. Aggregate & Vapor Barrier: 4.4.1. Backfill the trench completely with drainage aggregate, leveling it with the surrounding sub-base. 4.4.2. A layer of filter fabric may be placed over the aggregate trench as an optional, additional protective measure. 4.4.3. The basement vapor barrier shall be installed over the entire sub-base, including the top of the interior drain trench.

5.0 Sump Pump & Discharge System 5.1. Sump Basin Installation: The sump basin shall be set in a pit with its top flush with the finished concrete slab. The bottom of the pit should have several inches of drainage aggregate for a stable base. 5.2. Discharge Piping: 5.2.1. Install the sump pump within the basin according to the manufacturer's specifications. 5.2.2. The discharge pipe shall be 1.5-inch Schedule 40 PVC. A check valve must be installed on the discharge line to prevent backflow. 5.2.3. The discharge line shall be routed to the exterior and must terminate a minimum of 10 feet away from the foundation. 5.3. Discharge Location: Per Springettsbury Township ordinance ยง 281-29, discharge shall be directed to a vegetated area, a dry well, or other approved infiltration system. Under no circumstances shall the foundation drain system be connected to the sanitary sewer. The termination point must not cause erosion or discharge onto neighboring properties, sidewalks, or driveways. 5.4. Final Connections: Ensure the sump pump is connected to a dedicated GFCI-protected electrical outlet. Test the system by filling the basin with water to verify the automatic float switch and pump are operating correctly.

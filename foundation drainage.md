# Foundation Drainage System Installation

## System Overview
The foundation drainage system requirements vary by location:
- **Basement areas**: Shall have both interior and exterior drainage systems installed for comprehensive moisture protection. Both systems shall connect to their own sump pump basins for discharge.
- **Garage areas**: Shall have only the exterior drainage system installed. The garage system shall be completely separate from the house system and discharge directly to daylight via gravity flow without requiring a sump pump. 

## Exterior Foundation Drain System Installation
### Foundation Preparation
After foundation footings are poured and cured, and prior to installing the drainage system, apply the specified damp proofing or waterproofing membrane to the exterior foundation walls. Allow membrane to cure as per manufacturer's instructions.
### Trench Excavation
The trench for the drainpipe shall be excavated alongside the footing.
### Pipe Placement & Slope
- Place a minimum 2-inch base of drainage aggregate in the bottom of the trench.
- Install the 4-inch perforated PVC pipe, fitted with a filter sock, on top of the aggregate base. The top of the pipe shall be set at or slightly below the top of the concrete footing.
- The pipe shall be laid with a positive slope of at least 1/8 inch per foot (1% grade) towards the discharge point (sump pit or daylight exit). Use a builder's level to verify slope continuously.
- Connect pipe sections using appropriate PVC fittings. A continuous loop around the foundation is required.
### Aggregate Backfill
- Carefully backfill over and around the pipe with drainage aggregate.
- The aggregate shall extend to a minimum of 6 inches above the top of the footing and a minimum of 12 inches horizontally from the face of the foundation wall.
### Filter Fabric Installation
- Lay the non-woven geotextile filter fabric over the top of the aggregate, overlapping all seams by at least 12 inches.
- The fabric should extend up the foundation wall by at least 12 inches and be temporarily secured. This separates the drainage aggregate from the backfill soil, preventing clogging.
### Connection to Sump Pit (Basement Areas Only)
For basement areas only, a solid PVC pipe shall be used to connect the high point of the exterior footing drain to one of the knockout inlets on the exterior sump basin. Ensure a watertight seal at the basin penetration.

### Direct Discharge to Daylight (Garage Areas Only)
For garage areas, the exterior footing drain shall be connected to a solid PVC pipe that slopes continuously to a daylight exit point. The discharge point must be located a minimum of 10 feet away from the foundation and comply with Springettsbury Township ordinance ยง 281-29.
### Initial Backfill
Place an initial 12-inch layer of native soil or approved fill material carefully over the filter fabric to hold it in place. Do not use heavy machinery directly over the drain system. Final backfilling can proceed after inspection approval.

## Interior Foundation Drain System Installation
### Pre-Slab Preparation
This system is installed after the basement sub-base is graded and compacted, but before the vapor barrier and concrete slab are placed.
### Trenching
A trench shall be created around the full interior perimeter of the basement, adjacent to the footing.
### Pipe Installation
- Place a 2-inch base of drainage aggregate in the trench.
- Install 4-inch perforated PVC pipe (with perforations down) on the aggregate base, maintaining a positive slope towards the interior sump basin.
- Connect the pipe into a continuous loop and run a solid pipe from the loop to the interior sump basin, ensuring a watertight connection.
### Aggregate & Vapor Barrier
- Backfill the trench completely with drainage aggregate, leveling it with the surrounding sub-base.
- A layer of filter fabric may be placed over the aggregate trench as an optional, additional protective measure.
- The basement vapor barrier shall be installed over the entire sub-base, including the top of the interior drain trench.

## Sump Pump & Discharge System (Basement Areas Only)
### Interior Sump Basin Installation
The interior sump basin shall be set in a pit with its top flush with the finished concrete slab. The bottom of the pit should have several inches of drainage aggregate for a stable base.
### Exterior Sump Basin Installation
The exterior sump basin shall be installed outside the foundation at a depth that allows proper drainage from the exterior footing drains. The basin should be accessible for maintenance and positioned on the North East side of the basement to facilitate proper discharge routing.
### Discharge Piping
- Install sump pumps within both basins according to the manufacturer's specifications.
- The discharge pipes shall be 2-inch Schedule 40 PVC. Check valves must be installed on both discharge lines to prevent backflow.
- The discharge lines shall be routed to the exterior and must terminate a minimum of 10 feet away from the foundation.
### Discharge Location
Per Springettsbury Township ordinance ยง 281-29, discharge shall be directed to a vegetated area, a dry well, or other approved infiltration system. Under no circumstances shall the foundation drain system be connected to the sanitary sewer. The termination point must not cause erosion or discharge onto neighboring properties, sidewalks, or driveways.

Note: For garage areas with direct daylight discharge, the same discharge location requirements apply, but no sump pump system is required.
### Final Connections (Basement Areas Only)
Ensure both sump pumps are connected to dedicated GFCI-protected electrical outlets. Test both systems by filling the basins with water to verify the automatic float switches and pumps are operating correctly.

## Materials
### Perforated Pipe
4-inch diameter, white perforated PVC pipe conforming to ASTM D2729. Perforations shall be oriented downwards (at the 4 and 8 o'clock positions) upon installation.
### Solid Pipe
4-inch diameter, white solid PVC sewer and drain pipe (ASTM D2729 or Schedule 40) for discharge lines from the sump pump and for solid runs to daylight if applicable.
### Drainage Aggregate
Washed, clean, crushed stone or gravel, 3/4-inch to 1.5-inch in diameter. Must be free of fines, dirt, and organic material.
### Filter Fabric
Non-woven geotextile filter fabric, rated for soil filtration and drainage applications. To be used to wrap the aggregate trench.
### Pipe Filter Sock
Spun-polyester or similar filter "sock" designed to fit over 4-inch perforated pipe.
### Damp proofing/Waterproofing
As per architectural plans. At a minimum, foundation walls shall be damp proofed. A trowel-applied or spray-on waterproofing membrane is highly recommended.
### Sump Basins & Pumps (Basement Areas Only)
Two 24-inch diameter, sealed sump basins with solid, lockable covers (one interior, one exterior). Sump pumps shall be a minimum 1/3 HP submersible cast-iron models with automatic float switches.

### **Stairwell Pony Wall**
 install a metal connector, such as a Simpson Strong-Tie A35 Framing Angle, on the interior face of each stud-to-top-plate connection.

 Secure the bottom plate to the floor structure using 3-inch structural screws (e.g., FastenMaster TimberLOK) 
#### **Pony wall strong back left side**

 The pony wall must be framed with a double 2x6 stud at the connection point to provide a 3-inch thick member for the hanger's fasteners to anchor into. Use simpson LUS28-2 or similar

#### **Beam pocket for right side**

Establish Location: Determine the exact elevation for the bottom of the strong back. This will be the height of the pocket's sill. Mark the outline of the double 2x8 strong back (nominally 3 inches wide by 7 ¼ inches high) on the wall's top and bottom plates during layout. Allow for an extra ½ inch of width and ¼ inch of height in the rough opening for ease of installation and shimming.

King Studs: At the location of the pocket, install two full-height king studs, running from the bottom plate to the top plate. These will define the outer boundaries of the pocket's support column.

Jack Studs (Trimmers): Inside the king studs, install a minimum of two 2x4 jack studs on each side of the opening. These studs are cut to the height of the bottom of the pocket and are nailed securely to the king studs. The jack studs are the primary vertical load-bearing members that will support the strong back.

Sill Plate: Cut a double 2x4 sill plate to fit snugly between the king studs, resting directly on top of the jack studs. This sill creates the bottom surface of the pocket and distributes the load from the beam across the tops of the jack studs.

Assembly: This configuration of king studs, jack studs, and a sill creates a robust column within the wall framing. The concentrated load from the strong back is transferred through the sill, down the multiple jack studs, through the bottom plate, and directly into the floor framing and foundation below. This method ensures the load bypasses weaker wall components and follows a direct, solid path to the ground.


#### **Strong back joist support**
Material Selection: Select two high-quality, straight 2x8 boards with minimal knots or defects. Ensure the crowns of both boards are oriented in the same direction.

# Foundation Drainage and Insulation System Installation

## System Overview
- **Basement areas**: Require both interior and exterior drainage systems, each connected to separate sump pump basins.
- **Garage areas**: Require only exterior drainage system with direct gravity discharge to daylight.

## Exterior Foundation Drain System
### Installation Process
1. Apply damp proofing/waterproofing membrane to foundation walls after footings cure. This can be a coating or a peel-and-stick application to prevent moisture from passing through.
2. Install minimum R-10 rigid foam insulation board against the damp-proofed wall.
3. Install dimple board over the foam insulation. Dimple board shall only be installed below grade.
4. Excavate trench alongside footing
5. Install 2-inch drainage aggregate base in trench
6. Place 4-inch perforated PVC pipe with filter sock on aggregate, top at or below footing level
7. Maintain 1/8 inch per foot slope toward discharge point
8. Backfill with drainage aggregate to 6 inches above footing, 12 inches from foundation wall
9. Install non-woven geotextile filter fabric over aggregate with 12-inch overlaps
10. Place 12-inch layer of native soil over fabric

### Connections
- **Basement areas**: Connect to exterior sump basin via solid PVC pipe
- **Garage areas**: Connect to solid PVC pipe discharging to daylight (minimum 10 feet from foundation)

## Interior Foundation Drain System (Basement Areas Only)
1. Create perimeter trench adjacent to footing after sub-base preparation
2. Install 2-inch aggregate base and 4-inch perforated PVC pipe (perforations down)
3. Slope toward interior sump basin and connect with solid pipe
4. Backfill with drainage aggregate level with sub-base
5. Install vapor barrier over entire sub-base including drain trench

## Sump Pump System (Basement Areas Only)
### Basin Installation
- **Interior**: Set basin flush with finished slab
- **Exterior**: Install on North East side, accessible for maintenance

### Discharge Requirements
- Install 1/3 HP submersible pumps with automatic float switches
- Use 2-inch Schedule 40 PVC discharge pipes with check valves
- Route discharge minimum 10 feet from foundation to SWM pond per Township ordinance ยง 281-29
- Connect to dedicated GFCI-protected electrical outlets

## Materials
- **Pipe**: 4-inch white perforated PVC (ASTM D2729) with filter sock; 4-inch solid PVC for discharge
- **Aggregate**: Washed crushed stone, 3/4-inch to 1.5-inch diameter
- **Filter Fabric**: Non-woven geotextile for soil filtration
- **Waterproofing**: Coating or peel-and-stick membrane for foundation walls.
- **Insulation**: R-15 rigid foam board.
- **Sump Equipment**: 24-inch diameter sealed basins with lockable covers; 1/3 HP submersible pumps

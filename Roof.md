## **Insulation**
### **Attic Floor**
- Install multiple layers of rigid foam insulation underneath the attic floor to achieve an R-value of R-49.

### **Eave Area**
- After the rigid insulation is installed, apply a 2" thick layer of spray foam insulation in the eave areas.
- This spray foam application should seal the ends of the rigid insulation panels.
- Install R-49 batt insulation on top of the spray foam layer.

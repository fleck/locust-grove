# Carrying Beam

### Beam size
W18x65

### Beam web stiffener
Two (2) full-depth stiffeners (one on each side of the beam web) centered over where the HSS column attaches. Dimensions: 5 inches wide x 3/8 inch thick x height of webbing ASTM A572 Grade 50. The stiffeners shall be welded to the beam web and both the top and bottom flanges with a 1/4-inch fillet weld.

### Center column
HSS 6x6x3/8 ASTM A500, Grade C

#### Column top plate
8 inches x 8 inches x 1 inch thick. Material: ASTM A36. 5/16-inch continuous fillet weld all-around the perimeter of the HSS column to connect to column.

#### Base Plate:
10" x 10" x 3/4", ASTM A36. Use a 5/16-inch continuous fillet weld all-around the perimeter of the HSS column to connect to column
A 1-inch grout space should be provided between the bottom of the base plate and the top of the concrete footing to allow for leveling.

#### Beam connection
Four (4) bolts, arranged in a square pattern. Use 3/4-inch diameter ASTM A325-N bolts.

### Center footing
6'x 6' footing with four (4) 3/4-inch diameter ASTM F1554 Grade 36 anchor rods, embedded in the center of the footing to attach to baseplate of center column. **Center footing shall be same height as finished slab, but isolated from it** with an appropriate compressible joint filler material (such as asphalt-impregnated fiberboard or closed-cell foam) 

Bearing Plate:

Size: 6" long x 8" wide x 3/8" thick    

Material: ASTM A36 Steel    

Finish: Clean and coat all surfaces with rust-inhibiting primer and topcoat prior to installation    

Foundation Wall Pocket:

Type: Blind pocket (do not extend through the full thickness of the wall)    

Dimensions: 9" wide x 7" long x 20.5" high

Exterior Concrete Cover: Maintain a minimum of 2" of solid concrete at the back of the pocket

Materials & Installation:

Grout: Fill 1" space under the bearing plate with 5,000 psi minimum compressive strength, non-shrink, non-metallic grout    

Reinforcement: Frame the pocket opening with supplementary rebar. Place two (2) #4 U-bars around the top and sides and two (2) #4 straight bars horizontally below the pocket    

Connection: The beam end shall rest freely on the grouted bearing plate. Do not weld or anchor the beam or plate to the foundation wall    

Construction Note: The beam must be pre-loaded with floor joists and subfloor before final grouting to account for dead load deflection    

Insulation & Sealing:

Capillary Break: Install a capillary break (e.g., dimpled mat or closed-cell foam) at the back of the pocket, between the beam end and the concrete    

Insulation: After grouting, fill all remaining voids on the sides, top, and back of the beam with closed-cell spray polyurethane foam to provide insulation and act as an air/vapor barrier

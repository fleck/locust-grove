# General Notes

This plan set provides building details for the residential project. Contractors shall verify that site conditions are consistent with these plans before starting work. Work not specifically detailed shall be constructed to the same quality as similar work that is detailed. All work shall be done in accordance with applicable building codes. Contractors shall be responsible and bear any fines or penalties for code, ordinance, regulation, or building process violations. Insurances shall be in force throughout the duration of the building project.

Written dimensions and specific notes shall take precedence over scaled dimensions and general notes. The designer shall be consulted for clarification if site conditions are encountered that are different than shown, if discrepancies are found in the plans or notes, or if a question arises over the intent of the plans or notes. Contractors shall verify and are responsible for all dimensions (including rough openings).

All trades shall maintain a clean work site at the end of each work day.

Please see additional notes called out on other sheets.
